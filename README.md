# Sword-Spiral-Animation
Sword Spiral Animation is a fun little Python project that brings a golden sword to life using spirals and loops. Built with the classic turtle graphics library, it creates a dramatic animation of a sword being drawn with flair. It’s not trying to save the world — it just looks cool and gives turtle something exciting to do.

# What it Does

- Opens a black screen
- Animates a golden spiral pattern that resembles a sword being drawn
- Uses simple loops and turtle movements
- Delays the animation start by 3 seconds just to build a bit of suspense

# Why?

Why not? Sometimes code doesn't need a reason, plus its just funn. This was just a fun experiment in combining loops and visuals to see what happens. Plus, turtle deserved something more epic than a square.

# Requirements

- Python 3.12.5
- Turtle - inbuilt

# How to Run

1. Just clone the repository
