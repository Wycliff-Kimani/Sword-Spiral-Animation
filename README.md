# Sword-Spiral-Animation
Sword Spiral Animation is a fun little Python project that brings a golden sword to life using spirals and loops. Built with the classic turtle graphics library, it creates a dramatic animation of a sword being drawn with flair. It’s not trying to save the world — it just looks cool and gives turtle something exciting to do.
